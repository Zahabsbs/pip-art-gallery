# Welcome to the pip-art Community Gallery!

This is the official, community-driven art gallery for the `pip-art` tool. Anyone can contribute and have their art featured for thousands of users to see!

## How to Add Your Art

The process is very simple:

1.  **Go to the `images` folder** at the top of this page.
2.  Click the `Add file` button and choose `Upload files`.
3.  **Upload your artwork.** It can be a static image (`.png`, `.jpg`) or an animated `.gif`.
4.  **(Optional but Recommended)** Upload a metadata file. This is a simple text file with the **exact same name** as your image, but with a `.json` extension.

    *Example:* For `my-cool-art.png`, create `my-cool-art.json`.

    **JSON file format:**
    ```json
    {
      "title": "Your Artwork Title",
      "author": "Your Name or Nickname",
      "description": "A short, fun description of your art."
    }
    ```

5.  Once your files are uploaded, **create a Pull Request**. We will review it and merge it into the main collection.

That's it! Thank you for helping make the terminal a more joyful place.
